// never enters deep sleep because the exit condition is always
// met (PULSE_PIN is HIGH) so the device enters an infinite restart
// loop that is not desired.
// the solution at this moment is to never enter sleep when
// PULSE_PIN is HIGH, this ensures the interrupt when failing
// is always detected.

// finish the LOW->HIGH->LOW cycle before the interrupt is set
